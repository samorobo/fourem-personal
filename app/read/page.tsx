              Ireland and the New Architecture
            </h3>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>A new architectural expression arrived in Ireland in the 18th century. Clean simple lines were</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>combined with Classical proportion and detail inspired by the architecture of Andrea Palladio from</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>the Venetian State of the 17th Century. Irish towns and cities began to represent a built form of the</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>philosophy of the new Age of Enlightenment that was sweeping across Europe and Palladio’s work</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>greatly influenced Ireland. This was the ‘Irish Age of Reason’ in architecture and formed the</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>greatest part of the distinctive built heritage of the country. It was a period of growth and optimism,</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>brought about by relative peace and trade. In the period between 1750 and 1840, the population of</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Ireland more than doubled from three million to eight million people and in that period many of our</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>villages, towns and cities were almost entirely rebuilt and, in some cases, redesigned in classical</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>form over medieval plans. Serious problems in Ireland which led to famine, population decline and</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>a lack of industrialisation in many parts after the 1840s meant that the architecture of the time was</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>greatly preserved until late in the 20th century.</p>

            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>the 18th and early 19th C. The examination of any one element of this architecture clearly</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>demonstrates the Spartan simplicity and practicality of an ambitious age of expansion in Ireland and</p>

          The Specific Architecture of County Cork

            </h3>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>County Cork towns were greatly influenced by ideas for building that came from northern Europe</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>combined with local circumstances and available materials. Dutch architecture heavily influenced</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Youghal, Cork and Kinsale in the 16th and 17th Century. This is seen in the steeply pitched roofs</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>and curved Dutch gables employed in each of the three places. All three also used slate hanging to</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>keep buildings dry which is still seen in Normandy and in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset. Trade</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>and new ideas came quickly to County Cork by sea and these new ideas in architecture translated</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>quickly across the county. </p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>In the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries people travelled to the birthplace of Classicism in Greek and</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Italian states to examine classical detail and proportion and they published their studies. Classical</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>language was then reinterpreted for use in the new expression of Irish architecture often based on</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>the principles of Andrea Palladio who had written his Four Books on Architecture in the 17th</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>century. Classicism based on symmetry and plain external detail became the architectural language</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>of a modern, progressive Ireland. The country took this design ethic on board with great enthusiasm</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>in the latter 18th Century, in more peaceful times.</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>The architecture of this period is concerned with proportion, simple forms and minimal fine</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>detailing. Economy of construction and of design are a way of thinking for the time. No other</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>country embraced this new age of simplicity in architecture as Ireland did as a way of thinking and</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>detailing architecture which then defined the character of the Cities, Towns and Villages. Once the</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>great invasion of classical and Palladian building forms became the norm they then began to</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>develop into a distinctive form adapted to local use but in Ireland the simplicity of the Palladian</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Building was maintained rigorously for over two hundred years until broken by the advent of</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Victorian opulence in the late 19th century.</p>

            </h3>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>In Ireland as in Europe in general, any buildings of a more public function had a significantly</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>different expression, in terms of scale or material character, to the general rows of houses that</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>contained the streets. The Greeks planned their cities to take advantage of changes in topography to</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>define public spaces and as a place to locate public buildings. This tradition has continued in</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>European urban development to this day. The first form of the public building in was in the temple</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>or church and then, here in our towns, in the 18th Century market house whose expression is always</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>of a significantly different form and scale. In the market house in Ireland we see commerce and</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>civic importance beginning to reveal itself in architectural scale and detail within the towns. As</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>commerce moved to individual producers and merchants the shopfront became the next expression</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>of design separation. In the beginning the shopfront would stand alone in its expression within</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>streets of rows of houses. Over time however many shopfronts were introduced to the more</p>

            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>In 18th Century Ireland, pattern books for builders were used as reference guides to inform accurate</p>

            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>Pattern books were particularly created for and referenced by building designers and displayed</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>different solutions for many different applications. In Ireland, extensive building at this time meant</p>
            <p className='text-[15px] leading-[1.2] text-[#848484] mb-2'>that tens of thousands of buildings were constructed in the period from 1700 to 1840 under a system</p>
